This document describes how to use the highlight video collector. To download match videos from YouTube, you must provide a .csv file containing a list of matches to download, with two main columns: matchId and videoLink.

	- matchId refers to the unique match identifier.

	- videoLink refers to the full YouTube URL of the match video.

An experimental matches_info.csv file is included so you can reproduce the same development environment used in the SoccerEventSpotNet project.

To download the videos listed in the .csv file, it is recommended to create a virtual environment with all required libraries. An environment.yml file is provided for this purpose.

Usage:



python video_downloader.py --output_path <output_path> --input_path <input_path> --options_path <options_path>"

Where:

output_path: folder or path where videos will be saved.
(default: "SoccerEventSpotNet/Common/Videos")

input_path: path to the .csv file containing the match list.
(default: "SoccerEventSpotNet/Common/MatchesInfo.csv")

options_path: path to a .json file with yt_dlp download options.
(default: "SoccerEventSpotNet/VideoCollector/DownloadOptions.json")

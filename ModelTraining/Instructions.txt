This module provide python scripts needed to perform a fine-tune on X3D-S arquitecture pre-treined on 
Kinetics 400 considering all environment constructed by previous project modules.

Usage:

    - Running training module:

        python train_model.py --h5_path <h5_path>  --labels_path <labels_path> --output_path <output_path> --batch_size <batch_size>

        where:
        - h5_path is the path to h5 file with processed tensors.
        (Default is "SoccerEventSpotNet/Common/Tensors/tensors_strategy_1.5")
        - labels_path is the path to processed labels folder.
        (Default is "SoccerEventSpotNet/Common/Labels/Exp1_1")
        - output_path is the desired output folder to save training checkpoints. 
        (Default is "SoccerEventSpotNet/ModelTraining/Checkpoints")

        Notes: 
        (1) - This training module implements a fine-tune on X3D-S arquitecture pre-trained on Kinetics 400, 
        in order to train all model you should change model import param "pre-trained" to False. Changing 
        model arquitecture may change model input shape, so be aware about models hyperparams before trying it.
        (2) - In order to train Exp_5 models you should run this script using the unique labels for each folder defined during it's label generation.

    - Running evaluting model:


        python evaluate.py --h5_path <h5_path>  --labels_path <labels_path> --output_path <output_path> --batch_size <batch_size> --num_frames <num_frames> --model_path <model_path>

        where:
        - h5_path is the path to h5 file with processed tensors.
        (Default is "SoccerEventSpotNet/Common/Tensors/tensors_strategy_1.5")
        - labels_path is the path to processed labels folder.
        (Default is "SoccerEventSpotNet/Common/Labels/Exp1_1")
        - output_path is the desired output folder to save training checkpoints. 
        (Default is "SoccerEventSpotNet/ModelTraining/Checkpoints")
        - model_path is the path to the model that should be evaluated.
        (Default is None)
        - batch_size is the size of processing batch during model infering.
        (Default is 8)
        -num_frames is the number of frames per video saved on tensor.
        (Default is the same as X3D_S pre-trained = 13 )

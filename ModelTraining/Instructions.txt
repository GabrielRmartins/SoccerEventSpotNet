This module provide python scripts needed to perform a fine-tune on X3D-S arquitecture pre-treined on 
Kinetics 400 considering all environment constructed by previous project modules.

Usage:

    - Install conda virtual environment:

        conda env create -f environment.yml

    - Activate created environment

        conda activate ModelTrainingEnv

    - Run training script:

        python train_model.py <data_path> <labels_path> <output_path>

        where:
        - data_path is the path to h5 file with processed tensors.
        - labels_path is the path to processed labels folder.
        - output_path is the desired output folder to save training checkpoints. 

    Note: This training module implements a fine-tune on X3D-S arquitecture pre-treined on Kinetics 400, 
    in order to train all model you should change model import param "pre-treined" to False. Changing 
    model arquitecture may change model input shape, so be aware about models hyperparams before trying it.

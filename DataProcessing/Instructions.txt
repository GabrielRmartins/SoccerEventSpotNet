This module provides all necessary script to process each data. 
The usual pipeline should be running python scripts on this order:
process_events -> generate_timestamps -> generate_tensors -> generate_labels

Usage details:

 - In order to prepare the working environment properly it's recommended
 to use conda environment specified by "environment.yml" file. 
    - "conda env create -f environment.yml"
    - "conda activate DataProcessingEnv"

Note: If you use other environment pay attention on opencv library download,
specially on linux system, you should install it with ffmpeg library support
and av1 codec to avoid video reading errors. In order to do so use:
"conda install -c conda-forge "opencv>=4.10" "ffmpeg>=6.1""

- Running process_events:

    python process_events.py <events_data_path> <video_info_path> 

    where:
     - events_data_path is the path to event data folder downloaded by 
     EventCollector module
     - video_info_path is the path for matches_info file provided on 
     Common module.

    Note: you can ignore passing these parameters if you use project 
    default strucure on previous modules.

- Running generate_events_timestamps:
    
        python generate_events_timestamps.py <output_path> <events_data_path> <video_info_path>

        where:
        - output_path is the path of output folder desired for generated timestamps.
        - events_data_path is the path to processed events data file (.csv).
        - video_info_path is the path for matches_info file provided on 
        Common module.

    Note: You can ignore the parameters if you used default paths on previous modules.
    If you want to generate different timestamps for each event (to test, for exemple, 
    if any heuristic can make event representation more accurate), you can should modify
    this module, creating functions to define start and end timestamps for each event.

- Running generate_tensors:

    python generate_tensors.py <output_file> <video_data_path> <timestamps_path>

    where:
    - output_file is the full path(if you want to save it in a different folder) or
    file name for tensors h5 file which will save processed tensor data.
    - video_data_path is the path of the folder with matches videos(.mp4)
    - timestamps_path is the path to timestamps file which will be used to
    video segmentation.

    Note: You can ignore the parameters if you used default paths on previous modules.

- Running generate_labels:

    python generate_labels.py <events_data_path> <output_path>

    where:
    - events_data_path is the path to processed event data (.csv).
    - output_path is the path to the output folder where labels 
    should be saved.
